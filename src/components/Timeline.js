            After a two year journey of University and self-guided learning, I

            Despite being on course for a First Class Honours Degree The
            decision was made to leave University and continue my programming
            journey 'on the job'.

          <div className="descrTL">
            I began my studies as a full time, mature student at the University
            of Huddersfield studying towards a BSC Web Programming. I gained
            experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Wordpress, PHP, SQL Databases,
            R, Cyber Security, SQL, Adobe applications (Photoshop, Illustrator,
            Animate), Figma.

          <div className="titleTL">Relocating to Yorkshire</div>
          <div className="descrTL">
            Just prior to the global pandemic I relocated to Yorkshire to be
            with my future wife. I secured a role of Export Specialist, training
            a new team for Drive Devilbiss Healthcare on export procedures and
            documentation. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Perhaps a blessing in disguise, the pandemic resulted in
            complications in carrying out my role, I was subsequently furloughed
            and used this time to reflect and choose a new path in my career. I
            decided to pursue something that merged my pragmatic, logical
            approach to solving problems with my creativiity - programming.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>In my personal time I began to focus primarily on
            JavaScript after hearing about how versatile and in demand this
            language is.

            John Yorke's Advanced Structure Masterclass

          <div className="descrTL">
            I spent a long weekend at Ealing Studios on a screenwriting class
            with John Yorke, previously head of drama at BBC and Channel 4.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I made many new friends and fond memories on this weekend.
            It was an experience that took me out of my comfort zone in many
            ways, specifically having to pitch a drama episode to a room full of
            people (and John himself) in a historically famous studio was
            something else.<br></br>
            <br></br>I believe my knowledge of storytelling has helped me
            professionally. I still like to write scripts in my spare time, much
            like programming, I become engrossed in the process.

          <div className="titleTL">London Screenwriters Festival</div>
          <div className="descrTL">
            Another example of getting out of my comfort zone. Too many memories
            and experiences to relay here but the festival is/was a series of
            events with guest speakers - some informative, some anecdotal but
            all inspiring. Meeting many like-minded story enthusiasts was great.
            A highlight is the elevator pitch where you must pitch your idea to
            a mystery guest within 30 seconds!

            I spent six happy years at this manufacturing company, exporting
            equipment worldwide and having to learn and adapt to the
            ever-changing world of exports.<br></br>
            <br></br>Many projects involved equipment/exports worth millions of
            pounds and so there were often periods of extreme pressure and risk
            but I learned to thrive in the experience.<br></br>
            <br></br>I owe a lot to this company in terms of my logic,
            organisation, confidence and belief that I can overcome obstacles
            that arise.

            Another hobby of mine for many years is music. I played bass guitar

            Eastern Europe.<br></br>
            <br></br>I wish I could say it all went without a hitch but there
            were cancelled shows, multiple flat tyres, near misses and
            navigation issues. Lets just call it a character building exercise.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>We disbanded not long after the tour but remain friends to
            this day.

            Before the hardcore punk rock there was the indie pop-rock of

            things I never expected in this band.<br></br>
            <br></br>Two tours of the UK supporting major label acts (Twin
            Atlantic, Far, Circa Survive), festival appearances, magazine
            coverage, attracting interest from some of my musical heroes.

            Just a day after my 20th birthday, after a 6 month battle with lung
            cancer, my mom passed away.<br></br>
            <br></br>As many other know all too well, it is distressing to watch
            someone you love fade away from cancer. There is little else to say,
            this changed the trajectory of my life massively. My family are far
            from normal and there were many things I was exposed to when I was
            too young to understand but my mom was the rock that tried to give
            me as normal upbringing as possible. As an adult, I'm eternally
            grateful for that.<br></br>
            <br></br>I try my best to do her proud every, single, day.

            I loved my Spectrum. It came with a lightgun and a game of 'The

            that would create little applications such as pong, hangman and what
            I can only describe as a digital spirograph.<br></br>
            <br></br>I thought I should include this as was perhaps a seed that
            was planted all those years ago that paid off just over twenty years
            later!
